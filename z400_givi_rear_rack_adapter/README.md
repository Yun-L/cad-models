## Key
B: Circle hole
A: Lower Pill hole
C: Higher Pill hole

all three come in pairs, referenced with -L or -R for left and right. e.g B-L refers to the left Circle hole 


## Measurements: (inner edge to inner edge)
### Caliper direct measurements:

B to B: 141.2mm
A to A: 100.2mm
C to C: 141.1mm

### Caliper pencil traced measurements:
B to B: 146.3mm
A to A: 104.6mm
C to C: 143.7mm
- not sure why these are longer, leaning more towards trusting this over the direct measurements because the direct measurements were more freehand

### pixel lengths:
B to B: 3455px
A to A: 2471px
C to C: 3394px


### px to mm ratios (using pencil traced measurements):
3455/146.3 = 23.6158578264
2471/104.6 = 23.6233269598
3394/143.7 = 23.6186499652
 
using the average as the reference ratio for all other measurements
(23.6158578264 + 23.6233269598 + 23.6186499652) / 3
= **23.6192782505 px:1 mm**


## All Other Measurements:
final values rounded to 2 decimal places


B:
- radius: 137px = 5.8mm
- B-L midpoint: (1297, 4453)
- B-R midpoint: (5027, 4455)
- B-L center to B-R center: 3730px = 157.92mm
A:
- width: 209px = 8.85mm
- height: 163px = 6.9mm
- A-L midpoint: (1833, 3584)
- A-R midpoint: (4513, 3578)

C:
- width: 335px = 14.18mm
- height: 159px = 6.73mm
- C-L midpoint: (1365, 538)
- C-R midpoint: (5097, 537)

Calculate A and C positions as offsets from B

A-L from B-L:
(536px, -869px) = (22.69mm, -36.79mm)

A-R from B-R:
(-514px, -877px) = (-21.76mm, -37.13mm)

C-L from B-L:
(68px, -3915px) = (2.88mm, -165.75mm)

C-R from B-R:
(70px, -3917px) = (2.96mm, -165.84mm)
